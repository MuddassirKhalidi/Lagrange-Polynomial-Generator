# Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation

This Python program computes the Lagrange polynomial for interpolation using the provided data points and plots the resulting curve along with the input points.

## Usage

1. Run the program `lagrange_interpolation.py`.
2. Enter the data points as coordinates in the format `x y` when prompted.
3. The program will compute the Lagrange polynomial and display the resulting curve on a plot.

## Example

Suppose we have the following data points:
```
(1, 2)
(2, 3)
(3, 4)
```
The program will compute the Lagrange polynomial and plot the curve passing through these points.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
